Simple Python program for downloading Youtube playlists as MP3 files with a progress bar. Creates a folder "Downloaded music" inside the destination directory set by the user. Should work to default to your downloads folder when you just click enter when asked for destination. 
Keep in mind that the playlist must either be public or unlisted, private won't work.
